This is just a list of things to fix and keep on our radar
during development. Most of this will get done eventually, but
volunteers can get it done quicker! :^) 

Email ~aristonl/link-devel@lists.sr.ht to take on a task and we'll add
your name to it. It doesn't mean that you're the only person working on
that task but it just means that you are 'maintaining' anything related
to that task (i.e. accepting patches, making the final pull request).

 * #2: Possible LibreSSL support (atl)

	It seems like a good idea considering that the OpenBSD team is pretty
	good at being on top of things better than the OpenSSL team (especially
	when talking about security vulnerabilities). Also, improves support for
	the BSD's and macOS natively (since LibreSSL is the default).

 * #3: Finish proxy implementation (FiRe)

 	According to Levi, in the proxy implementation commit, he wasn't able to
	be able to turn it into a class so we'll put this here.

 * #5: Finish man pages (atl)

 * #6: Fix linktest seg fault (atl)

 	From dmesg:
		[61973.788590] linktest[21256]: segfault at 9f0 ip 00007fd185d3d4ed
		sp 00007ffd8e5c90b0 error 4 in libssl.so.3.0.8[7fd185d23000+5d000]
		likely on CPU 7 (core 3, socket 0)

	Seems like a OpenSSL issue but it's unclear if it's our fault or OpenSSL's
	fault.
