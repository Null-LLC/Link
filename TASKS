This is just a list of things to fix and keep on our radar
during development. Most of this will get done eventually, but
volunteers can get it done quicker! :^) 

Email ~aristonl/link-devel@lists.sr.ht to take on a task and we'll add
your name to it. It doesn't mean that you're the only person working on
that task but it just means that you are 'maintaining' anything related
to that task (i.e. accepting patches, making the final pull request).

 * #1: There seems to be another IOT Instruction error with this, and 
   according to GDB, it seems like a pthread issue.

	LOG #1:
	website started on port 3000.
	terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  	what():  basic_string::substr: __pos (which is 4) > this->size() (which is 1)

  	This is related to removing pthread_join, I attempted this myself and fixed
  	the string issue, it still does not run correctly and will need to be fixed
  	in a later commit.
