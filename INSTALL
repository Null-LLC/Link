                            Link Installation
                            =================

To build the library, you can simply use the build.sh script like so:

	$ ./build.sh

To install:

	$ ./build.sh install # installs to /usr/local

To run tests:

	$ ./build.sh test # test everything
	$ ./build.sh test server # test *only* the server
	$ ./build.sh test client # test *only* the client

PREREQUISITES:

1. OpenSSL 3.x

	OpenSSL 3.x is needed to use Link. You can grab a tarball from:

		https://github.com/openssl/openssl

	Alternatively, you can install OpenSSL via your package manager of
	choice. A quick issue to note is that certain distros (i.e. Ubuntu
	20.10 and below) do not supply OpenSSL 3 in their repositories but
	OpenSSL 1.1.1.

2. zlib

	zlib is needed to use Link. You can grab a tarball from:

		https://zlib.net/

	Alternatively, you can install zlib via your package manager of
	choice. Contrary to OpenSSL, there's no reported issues with any
	version of zlib.

3. glibc >=2.35

4. brotli

	brotli is needed to use Link. You can grab a tarball from:

		https://github.com/google/brotli/

	Alternatively, you can install brotli via your package manager of
	choice. brotli is known to work on 1.1.0.

5. gzip

	gzip is needed to use Link. You can grab a tarball from:

		https://gnu.org/software/gzip/
