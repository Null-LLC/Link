                            Link Installation
                            =================

To build Link, it's just the normal 'cmake .. && make' and then 'make install'. 
Although, instead of using Make, we encourage you to use Ninja to build since it 
yields a faster build time:

	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ cmake -GNinja ..
	$ ninja && ninja install

By default, Link will be installed in /usr but you can easily change this just
by adding to the initial CMake command '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local'
like so:

	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local ..

PREREQUISITES:

1. OpenSSL 3.x

	OpenSSL 3.x is needed to use Link. You can grab a tarball from:

		https://github.com/openssl/openssl

	Alternatively, you can install OpenSSL via your package manager of
	choice. A quick issue to note is that certain distros (i.e. Ubuntu
	20.10 and below) do not supply OpenSSL 3 in their repositories but
	OpenSSL 1.1.1.

2. zlib

	zlib is needed to use Link. You can grab a tarball from:

		https://zlib.net/

	Alternatively, you can install zlib via your package manager of
	choice. Contrary to OpenSSL, there's no reported issues with any
	version of zlib.

3. glibc >=2.35

Please mail ~aristonl/link-discuss@lists.sr.ht if you have any issues.
